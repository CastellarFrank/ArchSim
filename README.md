ArchSim
=======

A tool to design and simulate hardware components.
-------------------------------------------------

This application was designed to help people interested in learning hardware design by giving a graphic representation of
the interaction between different components. 

The user will be able to define it's own components using Verilog. Test them individually and interacting with others on a simulation window.
To improve the debugging process inside the simulation window you can activate a signal monitor to track the current state of a selection of
signals.
